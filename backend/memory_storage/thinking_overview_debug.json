      "full_thinking": "The user wants me to explain the concept of \"量子纠缠\" (quantum entanglement). I've been given:\n- concept_name: \"量子纠缠\"\n- subject: Not explicitly provided, but it's clearly physics/quantum mechanics\n- topic: \"量子纠缠\"\n- memory_summary: \"新用户\" (new user) - this means the user is a beginner in this topic\n- context: Not provided\n- source_content: Not provided\n\nThis is a complex topic in physics, but the user is a \"new user\", so I should aim for a medium complexity explanation rather than a highly technical one. However, quantum entanglement is inherently complex, so I'll need to be careful with the balance.\n\nLet me assess the complexity:\n- This is a MEDIUM to COMPLEX question because it requires explaining a counter-intuitive quantum mechanical phenomenon\n- However, since it's a \"new user\", I should keep it more accessible\n- I need to provide intuition with analogies, but also maintain accuracy\n- I'll aim for 3-4 comprehensive examples\n- I should include common misconceptions about quantum entanglement\n\nStructure:\n1. **Intuition**: Start with a non-technical analogy that captures the essence - like two magical coins or dice that always correlate. I'll use the analogy of a pair of magical gloves separated in boxes.\n2. **Formal Definition**: Provide the quantum mechanical definition using proper terminology (entangled quantum states, non-local correlations, measurement outcomes)\n3. **Why It Matters**: Explain its importance in quantum computing, quantum communication, and fundamental physics\n4. **Examples**: \n   - EPR pair (Bell state) - the classic example\n   - Photon polarization entanglement - practical experiment\n   - Quantum teleportation - application context\n   - Maybe a simple analogy-based one\n5. **Common Mistakes**: \n   - \"It allows faster-than-light communication\" (it doesn't)\n   - \"The particles are secretly predetermined\" (local hidden variables)\n   - \"It's just like classical correlation\" (it's stronger)\n6. **Related Concepts**: \n   - Superposition\n   - Quantum measurement\n   - Bell's theorem\n   - Quantum teleportation\n7. **Difficulty**: \"hard\" because even for new users, the concept is inherently complex\n8. **Reasoning Summary**: \"Complex quantum concept, 3 examples with analogies for new user\" - wait, need to be more concise. Let me think: \"Quantum phenomenon, 3 examples with analogies for beginner\" (7 tokens). But let me try to be even more concise: \"量子概念，3个实例+类比讲解\" (9 tokens). Or in English since thinking in tokens is easier in English: \"Quantum concept, 3 examples with analogies for beginner\" (7 tokens). But the instruction says the reasoning_summary language must match user's input language, which is Chinese. So I need to write it in Chinese.\n\nFor Chinese: \"量子概念，3实例+类比讲解\" (8 tokens) or \"基础用户，量子力学，3例通俗化\" (9 tokens). Let me try: \"量子力学核心概念，3例通俗讲解\" (9 tokens). Or even shorter: \"量子概念，3通俗例子\" (7 tokens). That seems good.\n\nNow let me plan the actual content:\n\n**Intuition**: \n- Use the \"magic gloves\" analogy: two gloves in separate boxes, if you open one and find left glove, you instantly know the other is right glove\n- But emphasize the quantum difference: before opening, the gloves are in a superposition of left/right (not predetermined)\n- Emphasize the non-local correlation that can't be explained classically\n\n**Formal Definition**:\n- Explain that entangled particles are in a combined quantum state that cannot be factored into individual states\n- Mention Bell states for two qubits\n- Use notation: |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2\n- Explain measurement: measuring one instantly determines the other's state, regardless of distance\n\n**Why It Matters**:\n- Foundation of quantum computing\n- Enables quantum cryptography (BB84, E91)\n- Tests fundamental physics (Bell violations)\n- Enables quantum teleportation\n- Potential for quantum networks\n\n**Examples**:\n1. **Photon polarization entanglement**: Two photons entangled so their polarizations are always opposite. Measuring one as horizontal means the other is instantly vertical.\n2. **EPR paradox (Spin entanglement)**: The classic Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment with spin-1/2 particles.\n3. **Quantum teleportation**: Using entanglement to transfer quantum states (not matter) over distance.\n\n**Common Mistakes**:\n1. Faster-than-light communication - explain why no information is transmitted\n2. Hidden variables - explain Bell's theorem refutes local hidden variables\n3. Classical correlation - emphasize the superposition aspect\n\n**Related Concepts**:\n- 量子叠加 (Quantum superposition)\n- 量子测量 (Quantum measurement)\n- Bell定理 (Bell's theorem)\n- 量子隐形传态 (Quantum teleportation)\n\n**Difficulty**: \"hard\" - because it's a complex quantum phenomenon even for beginners\n\n**Reasoning Summary**: \"量子概念，3实例通俗讲解\" (7 tokens) - this seems perfect. It's concise and captures the essence.\n\nNow I'll write the actual JSON.",
