Let me quickly assess the complexity:\n\n**Complexity Assessment:**\nThis is a **MEDIUM** complexity question. It's a fundamental biology concept that requires both conceptual understanding and some technical detail, but doesn't involve multi-step derivations like advanced math proofs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- ✅ Moderate thinking (5-7 key points)\n- ✅ Detailed intuition with analogies\n- ✅ 3-4 comprehensive examples\n- ✅ Common mistakes section\n- Duration: 15-30 seconds\n\n**Key points for thinking:**\n1. Core concept: Plants converting light → chemical energy\n2. Need everyday analogy (factory, kitchen)\n3. Must include chemical equation\n4. Examples should cover: color observation, day/night behavior, CO2 enrichment\n5. Common mistakes: photosynthesis vs respiration, which cells can do it\n6. Related concepts: chloroplasts, respiration, carbon cycle\n\n**Reasoning summary:** Should be concise and match the input language (Chinese). Since this is a medium complexity topic with a new user, I'll aim for: \"基础生物概念，工厂类比+日常现象，3个生活化例子，2个常见误解\" (15 tokens).\n\nNow let me structure the JSON output:\n- concept: \"光合作用\"\n- subject: \"生物\"\n- intuition: Use factory/kitchen analogy\n- formal_definition: Include chemical equation\n- why_it_matters: Ecological importance\n- examples: 3 diverse examples as planned\n- common_mistakes: 2 as planned\n- related_concepts: 4 concepts\n- difficulty: \"medium\" (since it requires some synthesis)\n- reasoning_summary: Chinese, concise\n\nThe output format must be valid JSON with all required fields. The examples array MUST have at least 2-3 examples (I plan to provide 3).",

I have no explicit subject or topic provided, but I can infer the subject is \"生物\" (Biology) and the topic is \"生物-光合作用\" (Biology-Photosynthesis). No specific difficulty or card_type is given, so I'll use defaults or make reasonable choices. The user mentioned they \"just watched concept explanation\", so I should design cards that reinforce core concepts.\n\nKey aspects of photosynthesis to cover in 3 cards:\n1. Basic definition and location (what, where)\n2. Overall chemical equation (the formula)\n3. Light-dependent vs light-independent reactions distinction, or key details about the process\n\nSince no difficulty is specified, I'll aim for medium difficulty - not just simple recall, but also some conceptual understanding. Since no card_type is specified, I'll use \"basic\" as default.\n\nLet me plan the 3 cards:\n1. **Card 1**: Location and purpose - where does photosynthesis happen and what's its main function?\n   - Front: \"光合作用发生在植物的哪个细胞器中？其主要功能是什么？\"\n   - Back: \"叶绿体。将光能转化为化学能（葡萄糖），是植物特有的能量转换过程。\"\n   - Hints: [\"与光和绿色有关\", \"植物的'食物工厂'\"]\n   - Related: [\"叶绿素\", \"光能转换\", \"葡萄糖\"]\n\n2. **Card 2**: Overall chemical equation - the big picture reaction\n   - Front: \"光合作用的化学方程式是什么？\"\n   - Back: \"6CO₂ + 6H₂O + 光能 → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂。二氧化碳和水在光能作用下生成葡萄糖和氧气。\"\n   - Hints: [\"6个CO₂和6个H₂O\", \"产物是葡萄糖和氧气\"]\n   - Related: [\"CO₂\", \"H₂O\", \"葡萄糖\"]\n\n3. **Card 3**: Two stages - light-dependent and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle)\n   - Front: \"光合作用分为哪两个阶段？分别在哪里进行？\"\n   - Back: \"光反应（类囊体膜）和暗反应/卡尔文循环（叶绿体基质）。光反应需要光，产生ATP和NADPH；暗反应不需要光，固定CO₂合成糖。\"\n   - Hints: [\"光反应需要光\", \"暗反应不需要光直接参与\"]\n   - Related: [\"ATP\", \"NADPH\", \"卡尔文循环\"]\n\nThis covers:\n- Location and purpose\n- Chemical equation (core formula)\n- Process stages (deeper understanding)\n\nAll cards are consistent with standard photosynthesis knowledge. The difficulty is medium - requiring both recall and some conceptual understanding. I'll use \"basic\" card type as no specific type was requested.\n\nI need to make sure:\n- Each card is atomic (one concept)\n- Clear and unambiguous\n- Active recall focused\n- Concise\n- Includes hints and related concepts\n- Reasoning summary in Chinese (10-20 tokens)\n\nLet me count tokens for reasoning summary: \"3个核心概念：场所、方程式、两阶段。\" That's about 10 tokens. Perfect.\n\nNow let me construct the final JSON.",

This is a valid topic, it's in Chinese and could refer to many contexts - could be computer science (selection statements), biology (natural selection), or general decision-making concepts.\n\nLet me analyze the input:\n- subject: Not explicitly provided (NULL), but the topic is \"选择\" in Chinese\n- topic: \"选择\" (selection/choice)\n- difficulty: Not specified, so I should default to \"easy\" or \"medium\"\n- num_questions: 2 (CRITICAL: must generate exactly 2 questions)\n- memory_summary: User prefers concept explanations and just watched one\n- content_context, source_content, reference_explanation, reference_flashcards: All empty or null\n\nSince no specific subject is given but the topic is \"选择\" in Chinese, I should create general questions about the concept of \"选择\" that could apply across domains. Given the context of an adaptive learning assistant, I'll interpret this as a general learning concept about decision-making and selection principles.\n\nThe user wants concept explanations, so I should focus on conceptual understanding rather than pure factual recall. The difficulty isn't specified, so I'll aim for \"medium\" as a balanced approach.\n\nI need to generate exactly 2 questions. Let me think about what types would be appropriate:\n\n1. A multiple choice question about the key factors in making good choices\n2. A short answer question about evaluating options\n\nLet me plan:\n- Question 1: Multiple choice about the components of a rational decision-making process\n- Question 2: Short answer about common biases in selection/decision-making\n\nThis would test both recognition and application of concepts.\n\nNow I need to make sure I follow all the format requirements:\n- JSON only, no comments\n- Double quotes for all strings\n- Escape special characters properly\n- Include all required fields for each question\n- reasoning_summary must be 10-20 tokens in Chinese\n\nLet me draft the thinking:\n- Generate 2 questions exactly\n- Topic: \"选择\" (selection/decision-making)\n- Difficulty: medium (since not specified, and user wants conceptual understanding)\n- Question types: choice and short_answer for variety\n- Focus on conceptual understanding as per memory_summary\n- Provide clear explanations and hints\n\nThe reasoning_summary should be very short (10-20 tokens) in Chinese, something like: \"概念理解为主，混合题型测试选择能力。\" (16 tokens)\n\nLet me construct the JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"quiz_set_id\": \"quiz_selection_medium_001\",\n  \"subject\": \"综合\",\n  \"topic\": \"选择\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question_id\": \"q1\",\n      \"question_text\": \"在理性决策过程中，以下哪个步骤通常应该最先进行？\",\n      \"question_type\": \"choice\",\n      \"options\": [\n        \"A. 评估各选项的优缺点\",\n        \"B. 明确决策目标和标准\",\n        \"C. 收集所有可能的选项\",\n        \"D. 做出最终选择\"\n      ],\n      \"correct_answer\": \"B\",\n      \"explanation\": \"明确决策目标和标准是理性决策的第一步。只有先清楚自己想要达到什么目标，以及用哪些标准来衡量，才能有效地评估后续收集到的选项。这个步骤为整个决策过程提供了方向和框架。\",\n      \"hints\": [\n        \"决策前应该先明确什么？\",\n        \"目标和标准在决策中起什么作用？\"\n      ],\n      \"related_concepts\": [\"理性决策\", \"决策标准\", \"目标设定\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"question_id\": \"q2\",\n      \"question_text\": \"请简要说明什么是'沉没成本谬误'，并举例说明它如何影响人们的选择。\",\n      \"question_type\": \"short_answer\",\n      \"correct_answer\": \"沉没成本谬误是指人们在做决策时，过分考虑已经发生且无法收回的成本（时间、金钱、精力等），从而影响当前理性选择。例如：买票看了30分钟发现电影很糟糕，但因为已经花了钱而选择继续看完，而不是去做更有价值的事。\",\n      \"explanation\": \"沉没成本谬误是一种常见的心理偏差，指的是人们在决策时过度关注过去不可回收的投入，而不是专注于未来的收益和成本。正确的做法应该是忽略沉没成本，只根据未来的预期结果来做选择。理解这一概念有助于做出更理性的决策。\",\n      \"hints\": [\n        \"想想已经花出去收不回来的成本会怎样影响判断\",\n        \"为什么应该忽略过去已经无法改变的成本？\"\n      ],\n      \"related_concepts\": [\"沉没成本谬误\", \"认知偏差\", \"理性决策\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"estimated_time_minutes\": 10,\n  \"learning_objectives\": [\n    \"理解决策的基本步骤和原则\",\n    \"识别常见的决策偏差\"\n  ],\n  \"reasoning_summary\": \"概念理解为主，混合题型测试选择能力。\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to verify the token count for reasoning_summary. \"概念理解为主，混合题型测试选择能力。\" is 16 tokens, which is within 10-20 tokens. Good.\n\nI should also check if the subject is valid. The topic \"选择\" is quite broad, but it's a valid learning topic. Since no specific subject was provided, I'll use \"综合\" (comprehensive) as the subject.\n\nLet me double-check the JSON structure:\n- All required top-level fields are present\n- Each question has all required fields\n- Options array is only present for choice question\n- Correct answer format is appropriate for each question type\n- All strings use double quotes\n- No trailing commas\n- Special characters are handled (Chinese characters don't need escaping)\n\nThe memory_summary says the user prefers concept explanations and just watched one, so I should make sure my questions test conceptual understanding. The questions I planned do that:\n- Q1 tests understanding of decision-making process hierarchy\n- Q2 tests understanding of a specific cognitive bias concept\n\nBoth are conceptual and require more than simple recall.\n\nI need to ensure I generate EXACTLY 2 questions. My plan has 2 questions. Good.\n\nThe difficulty is medium, which is appropriate for conceptual questions that require some analysis.\n\nThe estimated_time_minutes should be reasonable. For 2 medium-difficulty conceptual questions, 10 minutes seems appropriate (5 minutes per question).\n\nlearning_objectives should be concise and reflect what the questions test. I have two objectives that cover both questions.\n\nEverything looks correct. Let me finalize the JSON output.",
