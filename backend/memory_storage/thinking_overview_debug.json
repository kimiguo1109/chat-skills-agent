      "full_thinking": "The user wants me to explain the causes of World War II. The memory summary says \"new user\" which means I should keep it simple and clear. The context type is \"clear\" so no special constraints.\n\nLet me structure the JSON output:\n\nconcept: \"二战的起因\" (Causes of World War II)\nsubject: \"History\"\nintuition: I need a simple analogy that connects to everyday life. Maybe something about how small problems can escalate when ignored, like a family dispute or workplace conflict. Something like: \"Think of it like a family argument where old grudges, bullying, and failed attempts to keep peace eventually make everyone explode into a huge fight.\"\nformal_definition: I need an academic definition in Chinese since the topic is in Chinese. Should cover the multifaceted causes: Treaty of Versailles, economic crisis, rise of fascism, appeasement policy, etc.\nwhy_it_matters: This should explain why understanding WWII causes is important - to prevent future conflicts, understand modern world order, etc.\nexamples: Need 2-3 progressive examples. Maybe starting with Treaty of Versailles, then economic crisis, then appeasement.\ncommon_mistakes: Common misconceptions like \"it was just Hitler's fault\" or \"the Treaty of Versailles alone caused it\"\nrelated_concepts: League of Nations, Fascism, Appeasement policy, Treaty of Versailles, Great Depression\ndifficulty: Since it's a new user, should be \"easy\" or \"medium\". WWII causes is somewhat complex, so \"medium\" might be better to provide enough depth without overwhelming.\nreasoning_summary: Must be <=20 tokens. Something like \"Understanding WWII's complex origins prevents future conflicts.\"\n\nLet me count tokens for reasoning_summary: \"Understanding WWII's complex origins prevents future conflicts.\" - that's about 7 tokens, well under 20.\n\nNow, I need to write this all in Chinese as the topic is in Chinese. The guidelines say \"Respond in user's language\".\n\nLet me draft each part:\n\nconcept: \"二战的起因\"\nsubject: \"历史\"\nintuition: \"想象一个家庭长期积怨：大儿子被严厉惩罚后心怀不满（凡尔赛条约），父亲失业后脾气暴躁（经济大萧条），弟弟趁机欺负弱小（法西斯扩张），长辈一味退让（绥靖政策），最终全家爆发激烈冲突。\" - This is 3 sentences, good analogy.\nformal_definition: \"第二次世界大战的起因是多方面因素交织的系统性崩溃，主要包括：《凡尔赛条约》对德国的严厉制裁导致其经济崩溃与民族复仇主义；1929年经济大萧条引发全球政治极端化；法西斯主义在德意日的崛起与扩张；英法等民主国家的绥靖政策失效；国际联盟集体安全体系的瓦解。用公式可概括为：$\\\\text{二战起因} = \\\\text{结构性矛盾} + \\\\text{经济危机} + \\\\text{极端意识形态} + \\\\text{国际秩序失灵}$\"\nwhy_it_matters: \"理解二战起因对认识现代国际秩序至关重要。它揭示了和平条约如何成为新战争的种子，经济绝望如何催生极端主义，以及妥协退让如何鼓励侵略者。这些教训直接塑造了二战后的联合国体系、欧洲一体化和当代国际关系准则，帮助人类避免重蹈覆辙。\" - That's 2 paragraphs/sentences, good.\nexamples: I'll create 3 examples with progressive complexity:\n1. Treaty of Versailles - simplest\n2. Great Depression - medium\n3. Appeasement policy - more complex\ncommon_mistakes: 2 should be enough:\n1. \"只是希特勒的错\" - correction explains systemic factors\n2. \"凡尔赛条约是唯一原因\" - correction shows multiple factors\nrelated_concepts: [\"凡尔赛条约\", \"经济大萧条\", \"法西斯主义\", \"绥靖政策\", \"国际联盟\"]\ndifficulty: \"medium\" - appropriate for new user but substantive content\nreasoning_summary: \"理解二战起因有助防止未来冲突\" - 9 tokens, good.\n\nLet me verify everything fits the schema and constraints:\n- JSON is valid\n- All fields present\n- Intuition is 2-3 sentences: I have 3 sentences\n- Formal definition uses LaTeX: Yes, I have a simple formula\n- Why it matters is 1-2 paragraphs: I have 2 sentences which works as 2 short paragraphs\n- Examples: 3 progressive examples\n- Common mistakes: 2 examples\n- Related concepts: 5 concepts\n- Difficulty: medium\n- Reasoning summary: 9 tokens, under 20\n\nLooks good. Now I'll format it as clean JSON.",
